# Accelerator Scheduling

`make accelerator-plan` writes `.local/reports/accelerator_capacity_plan.json` and pairs it with `kubernetes/accelerator-scheduling.yaml`.

The design separates CPU burst capacity, shared L4 GPU capacity, and isolated A100 MIG capacity. Kueue ResourceFlavors model the quota boundary, while the ResourceClaimTemplate sketches the newer Kubernetes Dynamic Resource Allocation path for device-specific claims.

## Production Notes

- Keep Airflow pool slots below Kueue GPU quota so the scheduler cannot over-admit scarce accelerators.
- Use NVIDIA GPU Operator time-slicing only for low-risk non-isolated training sweeps or profiling jobs.
- Use MIG when memory and fault isolation matter more than raw utilization.
- Keep partition fanout behind Kueue quotas so backfills do not starve daily model refreshes.
